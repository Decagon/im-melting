# im-melting
I'm melting: optimally schedule public transit routes to minimize exposure to rain.

I want to get from A to B, but I don't want to get wet. `im-melting` will tell you when you have to leave for a public transit route which will ensure that you won't get wet, or will minimize it. This includes choosing a longer route if the rain will last for a long time.
